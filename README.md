# PhantomDriver-assets

Official binary and large-file asset repository for the **PhantomDriver** project.

This repository stores files that are too large or not suitable for the main firmware repo:
- Display assets (images, icons, fonts)

## Why a separate assets repo?
- Keeps the main firmware repository lightweight and fast to clone
- Avoids bloating git history bloat from large binary files
- Enables GitHub Releases and direct download links for users

## Planned folder structure
/images    - High-res renders, photos, UI assets
